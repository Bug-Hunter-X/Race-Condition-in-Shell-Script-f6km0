This repository contains a simple shell script that demonstrates a race condition.  The script creates two files and then runs two processes concurrently, each attempting to write to one of the files.  Because of the race condition, the order in which the processes write to the files is not guaranteed. This can lead to unpredictable results, and data loss or corruption.  The bugSolution.sh file provides a corrected version that avoids the race condition by using appropriate locking mechanisms.
